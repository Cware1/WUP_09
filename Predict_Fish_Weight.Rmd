# Predicting Fish Weight
```{r}
fish <- read.csv(file = "Fish.csv")
```

```{r eval=TRUE}
 
fish <- fish %>%
mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor))
levels(fish$Species)
Bream <- filter(fish, Species == "Bream")
Bream <- select(Bream, -Species) 
Parkki <- filter(fish, Species == "Parkki")
Parkki <- select(Parkki, -Species) 
Perch <- filter(fish, Species == "Perch")
Perch <- select(Perch, -Species) 
Pike <- filter(fish, Species == "Pike")
Pike <- select(Pike, -Species) 
Roach <- filter(fish, Species == "Roach")
Roach <- select(Roach, -Species) 
Smelt <- filter(fish, Species == "Smelt")
Smelt <- select(Smelt, -Species) 
Whitefish <- filter(fish, Species == "Whitefish")
Whitefish <- select(Whitefish, -Species) 
```

# For each of the three species of fish listed below, determine the best regression model and also the best 2 element regression model. Use the BestSubset Regression helper file.


## Perch
```{r}
Perch <- filter(fish, Species=="Perch")
Perch <- select(Perch, -"Species")
```

### Best Models

```{r}
library(leaps)
regsubsets.out <-
    regsubsets(Weight ~ .,
               data = Perch,
               nbest = 1,       # 1 best model for each number of predictors
               nvmax = NULL,    # NULL for no limit on number of variables
               force.in = NULL, force.out = NULL,
               method = "exhaustive")

summary.out <- summary(regsubsets.out)
as.data.frame(summary.out$outmat)
library(car)
subsets(regsubsets.out,statistic="adjr2",legend="topright",main="Adjusted R^2")
```

Per the data, the Best Two regressor model is H-W. The overall best model is also H-W. 

### Best Two regressor model

```{r}
best.model <- lm(Weight~Height+Width,data=Perch)
summary(best.model)
```

The best two regression models and the best model are the same. H-W is the best model


## Pike
```{r}
Pike <- filter(fish, Species=="Pike")
Pike <- select(Pike, -"Species")
```

### Best Models

```{r}
library(leaps)
regsubsets.out <-
    regsubsets(Weight ~ .,
               data = Pike,
               nbest = 1,       # 1 best model for each number of predictors
               nvmax = NULL,    # NULL for no limit on number of variables
               force.in = NULL, force.out = NULL,
               method = "exhaustive")

summary.out <- summary(regsubsets.out)
as.data.frame(summary.out$outmat)
library(car)
subsets(regsubsets.out,statistic="adjr2",legend="bottomright",main="Adjusted R^2")
```



Per the data, the Best Two regressor model is L1-L2. The best overall model is L1-L2-L3-H-W.    

### Best Two regressor model

```{r}
best.model <- lm(Weight~Height+Width,data=Pike)
summary(best.model)
```

Per the data, the Best Two regressor model is L1-L3.

## Roach

```{r}
Roach <- filter(fish, Species=="Roach")
Roach <- select(Roach, -"Species")
```


### Best Models

```{r}
library(leaps)
regsubsets.out <-
    regsubsets(Weight ~ .,
               data = Roach,
               nbest = 1,       # 1 best model for each number of predictors
               nvmax = NULL,    # NULL for no limit on number of variables
               force.in = NULL, force.out = NULL,
               method = "exhaustive")

summary.out <- summary(regsubsets.out)
as.data.frame(summary.out$outmat)
library(car)
subsets(regsubsets.out,statistic="adjr2",legend="topright",main="Adjusted R^2")
```

Per the data, the Best Two regressor model is L3-W. L3-W is also the best overall.

### Best Two regressor model

```{r}
best.model <- lm(Weight~Height+Width,data=Roach)
summary(best.model)
```

Per the data, the Best Two regressor model is L3-W.

## Final Summary Statements

Per the data for Perch, the Best Two regressor model is H-W. The overall best model is also H-W. 

Per the data for Pike, the Best Two regressor model is L1-L2. The best overall model is L1-L2-L3-H-W.

Per the data for Roach, the Best Two regressor model is L3-W. L3-W is also the best overall.
